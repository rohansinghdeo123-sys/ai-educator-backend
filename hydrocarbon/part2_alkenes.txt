PART 2: ALKENES
SECTION 1: WHAT ARE ALKENES

Notes

Alkenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon–carbon double bond (C=C).

Because of the presence of a double bond, alkenes are more reactive than alkanes.

General formula of alkenes:
CnH2n

Examples:

Ethene: C2H4

Propene: C3H6

Alkenes are also called olefins, which means “oil-forming compounds”.

Easy MCQs

Alkenes are classified as:
A. Saturated hydrocarbons
B. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
C. Aromatic hydrocarbons
D. Cyclic hydrocarbons
Correct Answer: B

General formula of alkenes is:
A. CnH2n+2
B. CnH2n
C. CnH2n-2
D. CnHn
Correct Answer: B

Which of the following is an alkene?
A. CH4
B. C2H6
C. C2H4
D. C3H8
Correct Answer: C

SECTION 2: STRUCTURE OF DOUBLE BOND

Notes

A carbon–carbon double bond consists of:

One sigma (sigma) bond – strong

One pi (pi) bond – weak

Sigma bond is formed by head-on overlap of orbitals.
Pi bond is formed by sideways overlap of p-orbitals.

Because the pi bond is weak, it breaks easily, allowing alkenes to undergo addition reactions.

Bond length:

C=C bond is shorter than a C–C single bond

Easy MCQs

A double bond contains:
A. Two sigma bonds
B. One sigma and one pi bond
C. Two pi bonds
D. Only pi bond
Correct Answer: B

Which bond is weaker in a double bond?
A. Sigma bond
B. Pi bond
C. Ionic bond
D. Hydrogen bond
Correct Answer: B

SECTION 3: NOMENCLATURE OF ALKENES (IUPAC)

Notes

Rules for naming alkenes:

Choose the longest carbon chain containing the double bond

Number the chain from the end nearest to the double bond

Use the suffix “ene”

Examples:

CH2=CH2 → Ethene

CH3–CH=CH2 → Prop-1-ene

CH3–CH=CH–CH3 → But-2-ene

Easy MCQs

Name of CH3–CH=CH2 is:
A. Propane
B. Propene
C. Propyne
D. Ethene
Correct Answer: B

The suffix used for alkenes is:
A. ane
B. ene
C. yne
D. ol
Correct Answer: B

SECTION 4: ISOMERISM IN ALKENES

Notes

Alkenes show:

Structural isomerism

Geometrical (cis–trans) isomerism

Geometrical isomerism occurs due to restricted rotation around the C=C bond.

Example:
But-2-ene exists as:

cis-but-2-ene (similar groups on same side)

trans-but-2-ene (similar groups on opposite sides)

Easy MCQs

Cis–trans isomerism occurs due to:
A. Free rotation
B. Restricted rotation
C. No rotation
D. Broken bond
Correct Answer: B

Which compound shows cis–trans isomerism?
A. Ethene
B. Propene
C. But-2-ene
D. Methane
Correct Answer: C

SECTION 5: PREPARATION OF ALKENES

Notes

Alkenes can be prepared by:

(A) From Alkynes

Partial reduction gives alkenes

Lindlar catalyst → cis-alkene

Na / liquid NH3 → trans-alkene

(B) From Alkyl Halides

Alcoholic KOH removes HX

This process is called dehydrohalogenation

(C) From Alcohols

Heating alcohol with concentrated H2SO4 removes water

This process is called dehydration

Example:
Ethanol → Ethene + Water

Easy MCQs

Removal of HX is called:
A. Dehydration
B. Dehydrogenation
C. Dehydrohalogenation
D. Hydrogenation

C. Dehydration
D. Halogenation
Correct Answer: C

Br2 or Cl2 adds across the double bond
