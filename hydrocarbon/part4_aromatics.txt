PART 4: AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (BENZENE & ARENES)
SECTION 1: WHAT ARE AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS
Notes

Aromatic hydrocarbons are a special class of hydrocarbons that contain a benzene ring or a similar ring structure.

They are called arenes.

These compounds show extra stability, which is called aromaticity.

Examples of aromatic hydrocarbons:

Benzene (C6H6)

Toluene

Naphthalene

Aromatic hydrocarbons are more stable than alkenes because their electrons are delocalised over the ring.

Easy MCQs

Aromatic hydrocarbons are also called:
A. Alkanes
B. Alkenes
C. Arenes
D. Alkynes
Correct Answer: C

Which of the following is an aromatic compound?
A. Ethene
B. Benzene
C. Ethyne
D. Propane
Correct Answer: B

SECTION 2: STRUCTURE OF BENZENE
Notes

The molecular formula of benzene is C6H6.

Benzene has:

Six carbon atoms

Six hydrogen atoms

Each carbon atom is sp2 hybridised.

The molecule is planar and forms a hexagonal ring.

Kekulé suggested alternating double bonds, but the actual structure is a resonance hybrid.

All carbon–carbon bonds in benzene are equal in length.

Easy MCQs

Molecular formula of benzene is:
A. C6H12
B. C6H10
C. C6H6
D. C5H6
Correct Answer: C

Hybridisation of carbon in benzene is:
A. sp
B. sp2
C. sp3
D. None
Correct Answer: B

SECTION 3: RESONANCE AND STABILITY OF BENZENE
Notes

Benzene shows resonance.

The pi electrons are delocalised over the entire ring.

This delocalisation provides extra stability, called resonance energy.

Because of this stability, benzene does not prefer addition reactions.

Instead, benzene mainly undergoes substitution reactions.

Easy MCQs

Extra stability of benzene is due to:
A. Sigma bonds
B. Pi bonds
C. Resonance
D. Ionic bonds
Correct Answer: C

Benzene mainly undergoes:
A. Addition reactions
B. Substitution reactions
C. Elimination reactions
D. Polymerisation
Correct Answer: B

SECTION 4: AROMATICITY (HUCKEL’S RULE)
Notes

A compound is aromatic if it satisfies all of the following conditions:

It is cyclic

It is planar

It is fully conjugated

It contains (4n + 2) pi electrons

This rule is called Huckel’s rule.

Examples:

Benzene → 6 pi electrons

Naphthalene → 10 pi electrons

Easy MCQs

Aromatic compounds follow:
A. Markovnikov rule
B. Huckel’s rule
C. Hund’s rule
D. Aufbau rule
Correct Answer: B
