=== PART 3: ALKYNES ===
--- SECTION 1: WHAT ARE ALKYNES ---
Notes

Alkynes are unsaturated hydrocarbons that contain at least one carbon–carbon triple bond (C≡C).

Because of the triple bond:

Alkynes are more reactive than alkenes and alkanes

General formula of alkynes:
CnH₂n₋₂

Examples:

Ethyne (Acetylene): C₂H₂

Propyne: C₃H₄

The first member of the alkyne series is ethyne.

--- SECTION 2: STRUCTURE OF TRIPLE BOND ---
Notes

A carbon–carbon triple bond consists of:

Carbon atoms are sp hybridised

Shape is linear

Bond angle is 180°

--- SECTION 3: NOMENCLATURE OF ALKYNES ---
Notes

Rules for naming alkynes:
