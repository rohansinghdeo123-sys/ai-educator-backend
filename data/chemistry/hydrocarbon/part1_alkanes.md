CHAPTER: HYDROCARBONS (ALKANES) – CLASS XI (NCERT BASED NOTES)

------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION TO HYDROCARBONS
------------------------------------------------------------
Hydrocarbons are organic compounds that contain only carbon and hydrogen atoms.
They form the basic framework of organic chemistry and are the simplest organic compounds.

Based on the type of bonding between carbon atoms, hydrocarbons are classified into:
1. Saturated hydrocarbons (Alkanes)
2. Unsaturated hydrocarbons
   - Alkenes (contain C=C double bond)
   - Alkynes (contain C≡C triple bond)
3. Aromatic hydrocarbons (contain benzene ring)

Alkanes are called saturated hydrocarbons because they contain only single covalent bonds 
between carbon atoms and have the maximum number of hydrogen atoms attached.


Why are alkanes called paraffins?
The word 'paraffin' is derived from the Latin words:
- 'parum' meaning little
- 'affinis' meaning affinity

This is because alkanes are very unreactive under normal conditions and show little chemical reactivity.

Example:
Methane (CH₄) is the simplest hydrocarbon and is an alkane.

2. IUPAC NOMENCLATURE OF ALKANES
------------------------------------------------------------
IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature provides a systematic 
method of naming organic compounds.

Rules for naming alkanes:
1. Identify the longest continuous carbon chain – this gives the parent name.
2. Number the carbon chain from the end nearest to the substituent.
3. Name the alkyl substituents and indicate their position using numbers.
4. Use prefixes like di-, tri- if more than one same substituent is present.
5. Arrange substituents in alphabetical order.

Common parent chain names:
1 carbon – Meth
2 carbons – Eth
3 carbons – Prop
4 carbons – But
5 carbons – Pent

Example:
CH₃–CH(CH₃)–CH₃
Longest chain: Propane
Substituent: Methyl at carbon 2
Name: 2-Methylpropane

------------------------------------------------------------
3. ISOMERISM IN ALKANES
------------------------------------------------------------
Isomerism is the phenomenon in which two or more compounds have the same molecular formula 
but different structural arrangements.

Alkanes show structural (chain) isomerism.
This occurs due to different arrangements of the carbon chain.

Condition:
Chain isomerism starts from C₄ onwards.

Example:
C₄H₁₀ has two isomers:
1. n-Butane
2. Isobutane (2-methylpropane)

Both have the same molecular formula but different structures and properties.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. PREPARATION OF ALKANES
------------------------------------------------------------

A. From Unsaturated Hydrocarbons (Hydrogenation)
Unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) are converted into alkanes by adding hydrogen 
in the presence of a catalyst like Ni, Pt, or Pd.

General reaction:
Alkene + H₂ → Alkane

Example:
CH₂=CH₂ + H₂ → CH₃–CH₃
(Ethene to Ethane)

------------------------------------------------------------

B. From Alkyl Halides
Alkyl halides react with nascent hydrogen or reducing agents to form alkanes.

Example:
CH₃Cl + [H] → CH₄ + HCl

------------------------------------------------------------

C. Wurtz Reaction
In this reaction, alkyl halides react with sodium metal in dry ether to form higher alkanes.

General reaction:
2R–X + 2Na → R–R + 2NaX

Limitation:
This method is suitable mainly for preparing symmetrical alkanes.

Example:
2CH₃Br + 2Na → C₂H₆ + 2NaBr

------------------------------------------------------------

D. Decarboxylation
Sodium salts of carboxylic acids when heated with soda lime (NaOH + CaO) form alkanes 
containing one carbon less.

General reaction:
R–COONa + NaOH → R–H + Na₂CO₃

Example:
CH₃COONa + NaOH → CH₄ + Na₂CO₃

------------------------------------------------------------

E. Kolbe’s Electrolytic Method
Electrolysis of aqueous solution of sodium or potassium salt of carboxylic acid produces alkanes.

General reaction:
2R–COO⁻ → R–R + 2CO₂ + 2e⁻

Example:
Electrolysis of sodium acetate:
2CH₃COONa → C₂H₆ + 2CO₂ + H₂

------------------------------------------------------------
5. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANES
------------------------------------------------------------

A. Boiling Points
Boiling points of alkanes increase with increase in molecular mass due to stronger van der Waals forces.
Branched alkanes have lower boiling points than straight-chain alkanes.

Example:
n-Butane > Isobutane (boiling point)

------------------------------------------------------------

B. Melting Points
Melting points generally increase with molecular mass.
More symmetrical molecules have higher melting points.

Example:
Neopentane has a higher melting point than isopentane.

------------------------------------------------------------

C. Comparison of Isomers
Straight-chain alkanes:
- Higher boiling point
- Lower compactness

Branched-chain alkanes:
- Lower boiling point
- More compact structure

------------------------------------------------------------

D. Solubility
Alkanes are non-polar compounds.
They are insoluble in water (polar solvent).
They are soluble in non-polar solvents like benzene, ether, and chloroform.

Example:
Hexane does not dissolve in water but dissolves in benzene.
