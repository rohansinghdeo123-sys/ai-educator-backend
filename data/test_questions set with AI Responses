1. Fill in the blanks (1×4)



 i) General formula of alkanes is __________. -  

AI Response : (The general formula of alkanes is CnH2n+2. This formula tells us that for any alkane, the number of hydrogen atoms is 2 more than twice the number of carbon atoms. For example, methane (CH4) has 1 carbon atom and 4 hydrogen atoms, which fits the formula. Similarly, ethane (C2H6) has 2 carbon atoms and 6 hydrogen atoms, which also fits the formula. This formula applies to all alkanes, and it helps us to predict the number of hydrogen atoms in any alkane based on the number of carbon atoms.)



ii) The IUPAC name of (CH3)3CH is __________. - 

AI Response : To answer this question, we need to recall the IUPAC naming rules for alkanes.

The given compound (CH3)3CH is a branched alkane.

The longest continuous chain of carbon atoms is 4, and it has a methyl group (CH3) attached to the second carbon.

The IUPAC name for this compound is 2-methylpropane.




iii) The number of structural isomers of C4H10 is __________. - 

AI Response : 

(To determine the number of structural isomers of C4H10, we need to understand the general formula of alkanes, which is CnH2n+2.

In this case, n = 4 (since the formula is C4H10), so we can substitute the value of n into the formula to get C4H2(4)+2 = C4H10.

Now, let's draw the possible structures of C4H10. We can start with a central carbon atom and then add the remaining carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms.

One possible structure is butane (CH3CH2CH2CH3), and another possible structure is isobutane ((CH3)3CH).

There are two more possible structures: n-pentane is not a C4H10, but 2-methylpropane ((CH3)3CH) is, and 2-methylbutane ((CH3)2CHCH2CH3) is also a C4H10.

So, the number of structural isomers of C4H10 is 2.)





iv) Decarboxylation of sodium salts of fatty acids is carried out using __________. - 

AI Response : 

Decarboxylation of sodium salts of fatty acids is carried out using soda lime (NaOH + CaO). This is mentioned in section D, Decarboxylation. When sodium salts of carboxylic acids are heated with soda lime, they form alkanes containing one carbon less.

1. Consider the alkanes: n-butane, isobutane and neopentane.

a) What type of isomerism is shown by these compounds? -

 AI Response : 

( To answer this question, we need to understand the concept of isomerism in alkanes. Isomerism is the phenomenon where two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in their structural arrangement of atoms.

The given alkanes - n-butane, isobutane, and neopentane - all have the same molecular formula, C4H10. However, they differ in their structural arrangement of carbon atoms.

n-Butane has a straight chain of four carbon atoms, while isobutane has a branched chain with three carbon atoms attached to the central carbon atom. Neopentane has a highly branched structure with four carbon atoms attached to the central carbon atom.

The type of isomerism shown by these compounds is called structural isomerism, also known as chain isomerism. This type of isomerism occurs when two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their carbon atoms in a chain.

In this case, n-butane, isobutane, and neopentane are structural isomers because they have the same molecular formula (C4H10) but differ in their structural arrangement of carbon atoms.)





b) Arrange them in increasing order of boiling point. - 

AI Response : 

(To arrange the given alkanes in increasing order of boiling point, we need to understand the relationship between molecular mass and boiling point. As molecular mass increases, the boiling point of an alkane also increases.

Let's compare the molecular masses of the given alkanes: n-butane (C4H10), isobutane (C4H10), and neopentane (C5H12). Since n-butane and isobutane have the same molecular mass, they will have the same boiling point. Neopentane, however, has a higher molecular mass due to the extra carbon atom. Therefore, the order of increasing boiling point is: n-butane and isobutane, followed by neopentane.)






2. Write the chemical equations for the preparation of alkanes by:

a) Wurtz reaction - 

AI Response : 

(The Wurtz reaction is a method used to prepare alkanes by the reaction of alkyl halides with sodium metal. This reaction involves the substitution of the halogen atom in the alkyl halide with a hydrogen atom, resulting in the formation of an alkane.

The general equation for the Wurtz reaction is:

2R-X + 2Na → R-R + 2NaX

Where R is the alkyl group and X is the halogen atom.

For example, if we consider the reaction of methyl bromide (CH3Br) with sodium metal, the equation would be:

2CH3Br + 2Na → (CH3)2 + 2NaBr

In this reaction, the bromine atoms in the methyl bromide molecules are replaced by hydrogen atoms, resulting in the formation of ethane (C2H6).)





b) Decarboxylation - 

AI Response :

To write the chemical equation for the preparation of alkanes by decarboxylation, let's consider the reaction of sodium salt of a carboxylic acid with soda lime (NaOH + CaO) to form an alkane containing one carbon less.

For example, let's take sodium salt of propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂COONa). When heated with soda lime, it forms propane (C₃H₈).

The chemical equation for this reaction is:

CH₃CH₂COONa + NaOH + CaO → C₃H₈ + Na₂CO₃ + Ca(OH)₂

In this equation, the sodium salt of propanoic acid (CH₃CH₂COONa) is converted into propane (C₃H₈) along with the formation of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)₂).


c) Kolbe’s electrolytic method - 

AI Response :

The chemical equations for preparation of alkanes by Kolbe's electrolytic method are:

R-COO-Na+ + 2H2O --> R-CH2-R + 2NaOH + CO2 + H2
R-COO-K+ + 2H2O --> R-CH2-R + 2KOH + CO2 + H2

where R is the alkyl group.


3. Give reasons:

a) Alkanes are chemically less reactive. - 

AI Response :

(Alkanes are chemically less reactive because they contain only single bonds between their carbon atoms. This is in contrast to other hydrocarbons like alkenes and alkynes, which contain double and triple bonds respectively. The presence of single bonds makes it difficult for other molecules to react with alkanes, as there are no multiple bonds that can be easily broken or formed. As a result, alkanes are generally stable compounds and do not readily undergo chemical reactions.)


b) Branching lowers the boiling point of alkanes. - 


AI Response :

(To answer this question, let's first understand the properties of alkanes. As we discussed earlier, alkanes are generally colourless. Now, let's focus on the effect of branching on the boiling point of alkanes.

When we have a straight-chain alkane, the molecules are arranged in a straight line. However, when we have a branched-chain alkane, the molecules have a more compact structure due to the branching. This compact structure results in weaker intermolecular forces between the molecules.

Now, let's relate this to the boiling point. The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the intermolecular forces between the molecules are strong enough to hold the molecules together in the liquid state. If the intermolecular forces are weak, it requires less energy to overcome them, and hence, the boiling point decreases.

In the case of branched-chain alkanes, the weaker intermolecular forces result in a lower boiling point compared to straight-chain alkanes. Therefore, branching lowers the boiling point of alkanes.)



4. Write IUPAC names of the following compounds:  -  


To answer the question, we need to apply the IUPAC nomenclature rules.

a) (CH₃)₂CH–CH₂–CH₃:
- Identify the longest continuous carbon chain: 4 carbons (butane)
- Number the carbon chain from the end nearest to the substituent: 2-methylbutane
- Name the alkyl substituent: methyl
- Indicate the position using numbers: 2-methyl
- The correct IUPAC name is 2-Methylbutane.
10.84.81.87
b) (CH₃)₃C–CH₃:
- Identify the longest continuous carbon chain: 3 carbons (propane)
- Number the carbon chain from the end nearest to the substituent: 2,2-dimethylpropane
- Name the alkyl substituent: methyl
- Indicate the position using numbers: 2,2-dimethyl
- The correct IUPAC name is 2,2-Dimethylpropane.

1. Explain the preparation of alkanes from alkyl halides using Wurtz reaction. - 

AI Response :

The Wurtz reaction is used to prepare alkanes from alkyl halides. In this reaction, alkyl halides react with sodium metal in dry ether. The reaction is as follows:

2 R-X + 2 Na --> 2 R-H + Na2X

Where R is the alkyl group and X is the halogen. This reaction involves the replacement of the halogen with hydrogen, resulting in the formation of an alkane.


2. What is Kolbe’s electrolytic method? Explain with a suitable example. -

 AI Response :

Kolbe's electrolytic method is a process used to prepare alkanes. It involves the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of sodium or potassium salt of a carboxylic acid. This process produces alkanes. For example, when sodium acetate (CH3COONa) is electrolyzed, it produces ethane (C2H6) as a product.


3. Explain structural isomerism in alkanes with examples. -

AI Response :

(Structural isomerism in alkanes is a type of isomerism where molecules have the same molecular formula but differ in the arrangement of their atoms. This means that the same number and types of atoms are present in both molecules, but they are arranged differently.

For example, let's consider the molecular formula C4H10. This formula can be arranged in two different ways to form two different alkanes: butane and isobutane. Butane has a straight chain of four carbon atoms, while isobutane has a branched chain of four carbon atoms. Both molecules have the same molecular formula, but they differ in their structural arrangement.

Another example is the molecular formula C5H12. This formula can be arranged in two different ways to form two different alkanes: pentane and isopentane. Pentane has a straight chain of five carbon atoms, while isopentane has a branched chain of five carbon atoms. Again, both molecules have the same molecular formula, but they differ in their structural arrangement.

These examples illustrate how structural isomerism occurs in alkanes, where molecules with the same molecular formula can have different arrangements of their atoms.)


4. Compare physical properties of straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes. -

AI Response :

(To compare the physical properties of straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes, let's first understand the difference between them. Straight-chain alkanes have a single continuous chain of carbon atoms, while branched-chain alkanes have a chain with one or more branches of carbon atoms.

Now, let's compare their physical properties. Both straight-chain and branched-chain alkanes are colourless, odourless, lighter than water, insoluble in water, and soluble in organic solvents. However, there's a slight difference in their physical properties as the molecular mass increases.

Straight-chain alkanes tend to have higher melting and boiling points compared to branched-chain alkanes. This is because straight-chain alkanes have a more linear shape, which allows them to pack more closely together, resulting in stronger intermolecular forces. As a result, straight-chain alkanes are generally solids at room temperature, while branched-chain alkanes are liquids.

In terms of density, straight-chain alkanes are generally denser than branched-chain alkanes. This is because the linear shape of straight-chain alkanes allows them to pack more closely together, resulting in a higher density.

So, in summary, straight-chain alkanes tend to have higher melting and boiling points, and are generally denser than branched-chain alkanes.)



5. Write notes on hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. - 

AI Response :

Hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons is a process where unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) are converted into alkanes. This process involves the addition of hydrogen in the presence of a catalyst like Ni, Pt, or Pd. The catalyst helps to speed up the reaction. As a result of hydrogenation, the double or triple bonds in the unsaturated hydrocarbons are converted into single bonds, forming saturated hydrocarbons or alkanes. This process is commonly used to convert unsaturated hydrocarbons into more stable and useful compounds.

1. Explain in detail the methods of preparation of alkanes from carboxylic acids. - 

AI Response :

To prepare alkanes from carboxylic acids, there are two methods mentioned in the section. The first method is through the use of Decarboxylation. In this process, the sodium salt of a carboxylic acid is heated with soda lime (a mixture of sodium hydroxide and calcium oxide). This reaction results in the formation of an alkane that contains one carbon less than the original carboxylic acid.

The second method mentioned is through the use of E. Kolbe's Electrolytic Method. In this process, the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of a sodium or potassium salt of a carboxylic acid is carried out. This reaction also produces an alkane.

Both of these methods are used to synthesize alkanes from carboxylic acids.


2. Discuss the physical properties of alkanes with suitable examples. - 

AI Response :

(Let's discuss the physical properties of alkanes.

The first four alkanes are gases, for example, methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10). These gases are colourless, odourless, and lighter than water. They are also insoluble in water but soluble in organic solvents.

As we move to the next few members of alkanes, they start to become liquids. For example, pentane (C5H12), hexane (C6H14), and heptane (C7H16) are all liquids at room temperature.

Now, when we look at the higher members of alkanes, they become solids. For example, octane (C8H18), nonane (C9H20), and decane (C10H22) are all solids at room temperature.

As the molecular mass of alkanes increases, their boiling point also increases. This means that as we move from gases to liquids to solids, the boiling point of alkanes increases. For example, methane has a boiling point of -161.5°C, while decane has a boiling point of 174.1°C.

Another physical property of alkanes is their density. As the molecular mass of alkanes increases, their density also increases. This means that the higher members of alkanes are denser than the lower members.)

3. Explain IUPAC nomenclature of alkanes with rules and examples. -

AI Response :

(IUPAC nomenclature of alkanes is based on the following rules:

1. The parent compound is the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms.
2. The parent compound is named as an alkane by adding the suffix -ane.
3. The parent compound is numbered from the end that gives the lowest number to the substituents.
4. Substituents are named and numbered according to their position on the parent compound.
5. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order in the name of the compound.

Examples:

- Methane (CH4) - parent compound is methane
- Ethane (C2H6) - parent compound is ethane
- Propane (C3H8) - parent compound is propane
- Butane (C4H10) - parent compound is butane
- 2-Methylpropane (C3H8) - parent compound is propane, substituent is methyl, numbered as 2

Note: IUPAC nomenclature is used to give a unique name to each compound, making it easier to identify and communicate about the compound.)
