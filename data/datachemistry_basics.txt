CHEMISTRY BASICS — REFERENCE ONLY

1. Atom
An atom is the smallest unit of an element that retains its chemical properties.

2. Molecule
A molecule is formed when two or more atoms bond together.

3. Chemical Bond
A chemical bond is a force that holds atoms together in a molecule.

4. Covalent Bond
A covalent bond is formed by sharing of electrons between atoms.

5. Single, Double, Triple Bonds
Single bond: one shared pair of electrons
Double bond: two shared pairs
Triple bond: three shared pairs

6. Saturated Compound
A compound containing only single bonds between carbon atoms.

7. Unsaturated Compound
A compound containing at least one double or triple bond.

8. Sigma (σ) Bond
A sigma bond is formed by head-on overlap of orbitals and is strong.

9. Pi (π) Bond
A pi bond is formed by sideways overlap of p-orbitals and is weaker.

10. Hybridisation
Hybridisation is the mixing of atomic orbitals to form new hybrid orbitals.

sp³: tetrahedral
sp²: trigonal planar
sp: linear

11. Oxidation
Oxidation involves addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen.

12. Reduction
Reduction involves removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen.
